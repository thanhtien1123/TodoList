# TodoList

# Objective
Creating a todo list that I would use and feel comfortable using. The list is going to be saved in local storage so when the user start the program again, they can see the tasks that they saved before.

# Lesson learned
In this project, I learned to use boostrap, use the DOM to manipulate button, show tasks that the user have saved, save the task in local storage, alert user when they make a mistake of not including the task before pressing add button, clear the text field after the user press add task, choose if the task is priority to the user.
